        `Many people still use the manual strategy or technique of monitoring their
        inventory with the use of spreadsheets, and some still use paper and keep it all in their
        cabinets, despite the fact that the data they've acquired has a high risk of being lost,
        damaged, or worse, stolen. Since technology has evolved into a way of life and a driving
        force of modern industry, the majority of those who own or operate a business appear to
        be aware of ways to make their tasks more convenient and secure.
        Therefore, the researchers’ system goal is to develop a web-based inventory
        management system. This will increase the performance in stock management that will
        lessen the workloads of the staff since they had to track their inventories manually, there
        was a chance they wouldn't be able to keep up with overall sales, but with this proposed
        system, they’ll be able to make better decisions, and by tracking stocks on a regular basis,
        they’ll be able to avoid errors and other issues as well.`],
